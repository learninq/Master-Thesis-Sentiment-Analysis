Lol. Luckily I’m one of those ppl that values things for function over looks & these function well so far. They are seriously one of the most comfortable pairs of socks I’ve owned in 5 decades.  I have not tried to wash them yet, so fingers crossed on that rn.  They feel very cushiony.  I wear them in my winter boots & just on my feet shoeless around my home.  I wish they came in more colors.  I’m one of those ppl that absolutely cannot stand toe seams on socks, but these have not bothered me at all.  I have super high arches so the only change I would make to the socks would be some compression there.  However, the socks fit perfectly as-is which really surprised me given my arches.  I just like having compression at my arches bc it feels good on them.  I wear a ladies 10-1/2 shoe- mens 8-1/2 and I bought the medium socks. They fit perfectly.  That’s never happened.  I had honestly expected to have to get them wet on my feet & let them shrink to fit (as they dried on my feet to my size) since they are wool. Lol. I also expected to need sock liners as I’ve had issues with wool in the past (allergies- I knit & crochet it), but I’ve not had any issues with itching luckily. Hopefully the allergy is behind me now.  This week in northern Colorado I’ve worn the socks inside my boots in minus 15 degrees & can honestly say my feet were the only warm part of my body while walking my dogs.  Seriously thinking about making mittens out of a pair bc they kept my feet so warm. Lol.  Probably the best $15 I’ve ever spent on Amazon.  These are wonderfully thick & comfy socks.  They aren’t much to look at imo, but far better than the $28 Darn socks I tried before & that was for 1 pair!',\n","  'images': [],\n","  'asin': 'B07F3BDT8T',\n","  'parent_asin': 'B0BGFR76CF',\n","  'user_id': 'AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ',\n","  'timestamp': 1677321053520,\n","  'helpful_vote': 8,\n","  'verified_purchase': True}]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["with open(dataset_path, 'r') as fs:\n","  first_review = [json.loads(next(fs).strip()) for _ in range(1)]\n","\n","first_review"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7a47045c-280d-4b55-b164-44670fd3e4c1","metadata":{"id":"7a47045c-280d-4b55-b164-44670fd3e4c1"},"outputs":[],"source":["def read_reviews():\n","  records = []\n","  with open(dataset_path, 'r') as fs:\n","    for line in fs:\n","      json_text = json.loads(line.strip())\n","      records.append((json_text[\"title\"], json_text[\"text\"], json_text[\"rating\"]))\n","\n","  return pd.DataFrame(records, columns =[\"review_title\", \"review_text\", \"rating\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b9eeadf8-ae86-4672-b957-628d572373b8","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":107231,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722014876048,"user":{"displayName":"Manh Nguyen Hung","userId":"10659419222710976147"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"b9eeadf8-ae86-4672-b957-628d572373b8","outputId":"7a6ba21a-afb9-46f7-9405-adf835a8b3c3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["CPU times: user 1min 35s, sys: 11.5 s, total: 1min 47s\n","Wall time: 1min 47s\n"]}],"source":["%%time\n","df = read_reviews()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"mAJnD3zXV6x4","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":51,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722014876049,"user":{"displayName":"Manh Nguyen Hung","userId":"10659419222710976147"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"mAJnD3zXV6x4","outputId":"5b5c2972-04f3-4922-8411-6038ac6818c5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 19595170 entries, 0 to 19595169\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #   Column        Dtype  \n","---  ------        -----  \n"," 0   review_title  object \n"," 1   review_text   object \n"," 2   rating        float64\n","dtypes: float64(1), object(2)\n","memory usage: 448.5+ MB\n"]}],"source":["df.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"12d42e32-7cf2-45a7-a827-3e6885a25d04","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":19,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722014876049,"user":{"displayName":"Manh Nguyen Hung","userId":"10659419222710976147"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"12d42e32-7cf2-45a7-a827-3e6885a25d04","outputId":"b0c7c83b-05fe-4604-d10a-b020cdb72d25"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         review_title                                        review_text  \\\n","0        Crazy comfy!
